<h2> Who are we? </h2>
<p> As mentioned before, we're a group of developers who are teams making software and tools for other software for free and open source. No data is collected from you to us whatsoever. Everything if you use our app is completely entirely local. Your privacy? Our number one priority. </p>

<h2> What techstack do we use? </h2>
<p> We use Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and Svelte. We use this to make our app faster, stable and high-performance. We'll probably use more, but not now. </p>

<h2> Is there a official server? </h2>
<p> Absoulutely! We have an official discord server. You can join in right now and talk to people! <a href="https://discord.gg/VQBDWSSnRA"> Click over here :) </a> </p>
